before_profile.text=Being an elite pilot has always been your dream. You made it so far, starting out with a rusty old cargo ship ending up piloting a fighter in combat- the time has come, F.L.O.W. awaits you. You keep thinking about the infinite glory, but also the omnipresent danger of death as you start signing your application form..
after_profile.text=Congratuations, Pilot. You are now one of the elite pilots of F.L.O.W., the Federal Lunar Operation Wing. Our task is to deliver important cargo, messages and passegers safely through dangerous hyperspace routes. While the jumps we perform are dangerous, these areas of hyperspace are the only deposit of the valuable Crystalis. Thus, our task is also to collect Crystalis on our way. You will be assigned a suitable ship and perform your first jumps soon, pilot. Welcome to F.L.O.W.!

scenario1.name=Antimatter Problems
scenario1.intro=There has been a power failure in one of our outer-rim antimatter processing plant. Unfortunately, the base is not equipped to deal with this kind of incident. Your mission is to bring a team of engineers there to repair the damage. Remember to avoid the anomalies in hyperspace at all cost and to collect as much of the valuable Crystalis as possible.
scenario1.intro1.baseline=Thank you for your cooperation with D.O.P.E., pilot. Now report to the flight simulator in which you will perform a simulated hyperspace jump allowing us to measure your today's performance. Try to avoid the anomalies and collect as much Crystalis as you can.
scenario1.extro1.baseline=We adapted your ship so it suits your status best, it is ready in the hangar for you. The briefing for the first jump will be on board via your commlink. Good luck and fly safe!
scenario1.intro2=There has been a power failure in one of our outer-rim antimatter processing plants. Unfortunately, the base is not equipped to deal with this kind of incident. Your mission is to bring a team of engineers from this station there to repair the damage. Take your chance to collect Crystalis!
scenario1.extro2=Thank you. The maintenance team arrived safely and is now repairing the plant. It should be resuming operation by the end of the day.
scenario1.intro3=A load of antimatter from the plant has been loaded into your ship. It is urgently required by one of our mining bases in the Centauri solar system which is under attack by pirates. Its defence grid ran out of ammunition, it is your job to resupply it before the pirates destroy the base.
scenario1.extro3=The defence grid has been reloaded and is driving the pirates off. Take a break on the asteroid base and await your next orders.
scenario1.intro4=Hello, pilot! Your next jump will take you to the research station at Tau Ceti Alpha. You will pick up one of our top scientists on biogenetics there, Professor Wilmut. His presence is required elsewhere, you will be briefed on take-off from Tau Ceti.
scenario1.extro4=Welcome to Tau Ceti. No time for breaks this time, Professor Wilmut has already boarded your ship.
scenario1.intro5=No time to lose, pilot. You will immediately commence your jump into the distant Hourglass Nebula, where at the transmitted coordinates you will find a gas harvesting station. Professor Wilmut will supervise the loading of your ship with a small amount of a special gas mix required in your final mission.
scenario1.extro5=The gas mix is being loaded onto your ship, but stay ready for take-off at all time! As soon as the loading finished, Professor Wilmut will board your ship and you will be required to commence your next jump.
scenario1.intro6=The final jump today will take you to a distant research station in deep space. The impact of dark matter on organisms is being investigated there. Sadly, an experiment went terribly wrong and the base staff hast lost control of large parts of the station to mutated organisms. Professor Wilmut will use the gas you picked up to initiate a complex process to undo the damage done there.
scenario1.extro6=Professor Wilmut will stay on the station for a while to monitor the process. Most of the station's staff had barricaded themselves in the control room and survived that way.
scenario1.extro=Thank you for your excellent work today, pilot. We sorted out a safe hyperspace route for you to return to F.L.O.W.'s base in the orbit of Luna. Once you arrive, you will be debriefed and dismissed for today

scenario2.name=The Shadow war
scenario2.intro=Good morning, pilot. We need you to aid the terran naval forces in the shadow war today. As always, report to the Department Of Psychological Enhancement to monitor your stress and performance level. It is crucial that you give D.O.P.E. accurate estimations, to ensure best performance among all of our pilots.
scenario2.intro1.baseline=Thank you for your cooperation with D.O.P.E., pilot. Now report to the flight simulator in which you will perform a simulated hyperspace jump allowing us to measure your today's performance. Try to avoid the anomalies and collect as much Crystalis as you can

scenario2.extro2=Thank you. Now wait for the Grand Admiral to board your ship. Stand by for further orders.
scenario2.intro3=Having the Grand Admiral on board, you will perform a hyperspace jump to the Terran frontline in the Shadow war. You will then dock at the Terran flagship, the Achilles where the Grand Admiral will leave your ship.
scenario2.extro3=The Grand Admiral has left your ship and entered his command post. Stand by docked at the Achilles and wait for further orders.
scenario2.intro4=We received a distress signal from a scouting fleet in the Horse Nebula. Unfortunately, the signal was very blurred, so we do not know exactly what happened. You will immediately perform a jump to the last known location of the fleet and report in on arrival.
scenario2.extro4=Thank you for your report about the fleet being ambushed and destroyed by the shadows. The Federal Naval Command is currently arranging a counter-attack. Stand by for further orders.
scenario2.intro5=Being our only pilot close to the front lines, you are assigned with the task to support the Navy's counter-attack as good as you can. The FNC will not be able to commence the attack without special gear which was just completed at the Federal assembly plant in the Wolf 1061 solar system.
scenario2.extro5=The special gear is being loaded onto your ship. Stand by, ready for take-off.
scenario2.intro6=The special gear is being loaded onto your ship. Stand by, ready for take-off.

scenario3.name=Exploration
scenario3.intro=Good morning, pilot. The Association for Exploration of Human Habitats requires our services. As always, report to the Department Of Psychological Enhancement to monitor your stress and performance level. It is crucial that you give D.O.P.E. accurate estimations, to ensure best performance among all of our pilots.
scenario3.intro1.baseline=Thank you for your cooperation with D.O.P.E., pilot. Now report to the flight simulator in which you will perform a simulated hyperspace jump allowing us to measure your today's performance. Try to avoid the anomalies and collect as much Crystalis as you can.
scenario3.extro1.baseline=We adapted your ship so it suits your status best, it is ready in the hangar for you. The briefing for the first jump will be on board via your commlink. Good luck and fly safe!
scenario3.intro2=The AEHH found a possibly habitable planet in the Spica solar system. You will jump there and run a scan so AEHH can proceed with the preparations for colonizing, if the results are positive.
scenario3.extro2=The scan results were positive and are being transmitted to the AEHH. Stand by in orbit to receive further orders.
scenario3.intro3=In order to colonize the planet, we need you to deploy a beacon relais in the orbit of the planet. We transmitted you the hyperspace route to a manufacturing plant, where you will pick up a beacon relais.
scenario3.extro3=The beacon relais is being loaded onto your ship. Stand by for take-off.
scenario3.intro4=You will now go back to the Spica system and deploy the beacon relais in orbit of the planet you scanned before.
scenario3.extro4=The AEHH is now launching its freighters and colonization ships. Stand by, we have more work for you to do!
scenario3.intro5=There is another possibly habitable planet in the Betelguese solar system. As before, you will jump there and run a scan on this system. But be warned, Shadow activity has been detected in a nebula not far from Betelgeuse.
scenario3.extro5=You ran straight into trouble there, pilot! Although the scan results were positive and indicated great mineral abundancy on this planet, the whole system is infested with Shadows. Your retreat coordinates will be transmitted immediately.
scenario3.intro6=There you go. Retreat to the 6th Federal Naval Fleet. Jump immediately, it is only a matter of minutes until the Shadows detect your ship and will attack you. Once arrived, dock at the commanding Battleship, the "Archimedes". You will pass your intel on the Shadow forces to the commanding admiral, who will immediately initiate an attack to drive the Shadows off.
scenario3.extro6=You are safe now, as soon as the admiral dismisses you, return to the F.L.O.W.-base. We will transmit a safe jump route for you.
scenario3.extro=Great job today, pilot! Once you arrived safely at home, you will be debriefed and dismissed for today. You must be looking forward to a nice meal and your bed tonight.

scenario4.name=Kupier Trouble
scenario4.intro=Good morning, pilot. We need you to survey some operations for Deep Space Mining today. As always, report to the Department Of Psychological Enhancement to monitor your stress and performance level. It is crucial that you give D.O.P.E. accurate estimations, to ensure best performance among all of our pilots.
scenario4.intro1.baseline=Thank you for your cooperation with D.O.P.E., pilot. Now report to the flight simulator in which you will perform a simulated hyperspace jump allowing us to measure your today's performance. Try to avoid the anomalies and collect as much Crystalis as you can.
scenario4.extro1.baseline=We adapted your ship so it suits your status best, it is ready in the hangar for you. The briefing for the first jump will be on board via your commlink. Good luck and fly safe!
scenario4.intro2=This mission will take you into the Kupier Belt. Deep Space Mining experienced trouble with pirates there recently and they requested a report on a suspected pirate base close to one of their own bases.
scenario4.extro2=You found the pirate base, but it was deserted. That is a very strange discovery, especially because there were no signs of fighting. Stand by for further orders.
scenario4.intro3=Deep Space Mining wants another mining base surveyed. They lost all contact with this base earlier today. Check what happened to this base.
scenario4.extro3=Once more, you found a base suddenly deserted with no sign of a fight. This cannot simply be a coincidence. We will check what our contacts know. Stand by for further orders.
scenario4.intro4=Deep Space Mining wants you to survey an asteroid for minerals. Simply jump to the coordinates and initiate a scan on the asteroid.
scenario4.extro4=The scan detected abundant minerals, but there is something more essential. We have found a hint to what happened to the deserted colonies. Stand by for your orders.
scenario4.intro5=We have gained intel that there were several more colonies that were deserted just like that. Obviously one of the transport ships the colonists used crashed into an asteroid. Jump to the crash site and see if you can get some information about its destination.
scenario4.extro5=You retrieved the black box of the ship. We are going to process the data you sent us and will give you further orders for investigation.
scenario4.intro6=The black box contained the destination along with the captain's log. It contains some strange notes about some better world they would move to. Obviously we are dealing with some kind of cult among those settlers. Jump to that location and take a look at the situation.
scenario4.extro6=All kinds of settlers and criminals in fact created a huge colony here. We will report this incident to all parties involved. It will later be decided what to do with this colony.
scenario4.extro=Good job. You may return home now. You will be debriefed and dismissed on arrival.
