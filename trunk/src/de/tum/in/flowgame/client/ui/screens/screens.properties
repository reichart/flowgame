before_profile.text=Being an elite pilot has always been your dream. You made it so far, starting out with a rusty old cargo ship ending up piloting a fighter in combat- the time has come, F.L.O.W. awaits you. You keep thinking about the infinite glory, but also the omnipresent danger of death as you start signing your application form..
profile=The following questionnaire contains 13 statements about aspects to describe your personality. Read each statement carefully. For each statement fill in the circle with the response that best represents your opinion. The response range from "strongly disagree" (the statement is definitely false) to "strongly agree" (the statement is definitely true).\n\nThere is no "right" or "wrong" answer to the statements. Instead your response represents aspects of your personality as you see it.
after_profile.text=Congratuations, Pilot. You are now one of the elite pilots of F.L.O.W., the Federal Lunar Operation Wing. Our task is to deliver important cargo, messages and passegers safely through dangerous hyperspace routes. While the jumps we perform are dangerous, these areas of hyperspace are the only deposit of the valuable Crystalis. Thus, our task is also to collect Crystalis on our way. You will be assigned a suitable ship and perform your first jumps soon, pilot. Welcome to F.L.O.W.!

scenario1.name=Dangerous Science
scenario1.intro=Good morning, pilot. Your today's mission is to fix some technical problems in Luna's industry. As always, report to the Department Of Psychological Enhancement to monitor your stress and performance level. It is crucial that you give D.O.P.E. accurate estimations, to ensure best performance among all of our pilots.
scenario1.intro1.baseline=Thank you for your cooperation with D.O.P.E., pilot. Now report to the flight simulator in which you will perform a simulated hyperspace jump allowing us to measure your today's performance. Try to avoid the anomalies and collect as much Crystalis as you can.
scenario1.extro1.baseline=We adapted your ship so it suits your status best, it is ready in the hangar for you. The briefing for the first jump will be on board via your commlink. Good luck and fly safe!
scenario1.intro2=Hello, pilot! Your first jump will take you to the research station at Tau Ceti Alpha. You will pick up one of our top scientists on biogenetics there, Professor Wilmut. His presence is required elsewhere, you will be briefed on take-off from Tau Ceti.
scenario1.extro2=Welcome to Tau Ceti. No time for breaks, Professor Wilmut has already boarded your ship.
scenario1.intro3=No time to lose, pilot. You will immediately commence your jump into the distant Hourglass Nebula, where at the transmitted coordinates you will find a gas harvesting station. Professor Wilmut will supervise the loading of your ship with a small amount of a special gas mix required in your final mission.
scenario1.extro3=The gas mix is being loaded onto your ship, but stay ready for take-off at all time! As soon as the loading finished, Professor Wilmut will board your ship and you will be required to commence your next jump.
scenario1.intro4=The final jump today will take you to a distant research station in deep space. The impact of dark matter on organisms is being investigated there. Sadly, an experiment went terribly wrong and the base staff hast lost control of large parts of the station to mutated organisms. Professor Wilmut will use the gas you picked up to initiate a complex process to undo the damage done there.
scenario1.extro4=Professor Wilmut will stay on the station for a while to monitor the process. Most of the station's staff had barricaded themselves in the control room and survived that way.
scenario1.extro=Thank you for your excellent work today, pilot. We sorted out a safe hyperspace route for you to return to F.L.O.W.'s base in the orbit of Luna. Once you arrive, you will be debriefed and dismissed for today.

scenario2.name=The Shadow War
scenario2.intro=Good morning, pilot. We need you to aid the terran naval forces in the shadow war today. As always, report to the Department Of Psychological Enhancement to monitor your stress and performance level. It is crucial that you give D.O.P.E. accurate estimations, to ensure best performance among all of our pilots.
scenario2.intro1.baseline=Thank you for your cooperation with D.O.P.E., pilot. Now report to the flight simulator in which you will perform a simulated hyperspace jump allowing us to measure your today's performance. Try to avoid the anomalies and collect as much Crystalis as you can.
scenario2.extro1.baseline=We adapted your ship so it suits your status best, it is ready in the hangar for you. The briefing for the first jump will be on board via your commlink. Good luck and fly safe!
scenario2.intro2=We received a distress signal from a scouting fleet in the Horse Nebula. Unfortunately, the signal was very blurred, so we do not know exactly what happened. You will immediately perform a jump to the last known location of the fleet and report in on arrival.
scenario2.extro2=Thank you for your report about the fleet being ambushed and destroyed by the shadows. The Federal Naval Command is currently arranging a counter-attack. Stand by for further orders.
scenario2.intro3=Being our only pilot close to the front lines, you are assigned with the task to support the Navy's counter-attack as good as you can. The FNC will not be able to commence the attack without special gear which was just completed at the Federal assembly plant in the Wolf 1061 solar system.
scenario2.extro3=The special gear is being loaded onto your ship. Stand by, ready for take-off.
scenario2.intro4=The FNC is preparing a fleet to counter-attack the Shadows in the Horse Nebula. You will liase with the fleet close to the nebula and dock at the battleship Athene, where the special gear you transported is going to be unloaded and assembled.
scenario2.extro4=The new special weapon is being unloaded and mounted to the Athene and will ensure her to stand victorious against the Shadow forces.
scenario2.extro=You performed well today, pilot. This was your final mission and a safe hyperspace route back to Luna has been transmitted to you. Once you arrive at the F.L.O.W.-base, you will be debriefed and dismissed for today.
