Background-Screen-Idee: U.S.-Army Werbeplakat ("We Want You...")?

"Being an elite pilot has always been your dream. You made it so far, starting out with a rusty old cargo ship ending up piloting a fighter in combat- the time has come, F.L.O.W. awaits you. You keep thinking about the infinite glory, but also the omnipresent danger of death as you start signing your application form..."

"Ein Elitepilot zu sein, war schon immer dein Traum. Du hast es so weit geschafft- angefangen hast du mit einer Rostlaube von Frachtschiff und jetzt fliegst du Jäger im Gefecht. Die Zeit ist reif, F.L.O.W. erwartet dich. Als du das Bewerbungsformular ausfüllst, musst du nicht nur an den unendlichen Ruhm, sondern auch an die allgegenwärtige Gefahr denken..."

"Congratuations, Pilot. You are now one of the elite pilots of F.L.O.W., the Federal Lunar Operation Wing. Our task is to deliver important cargo, messages and passegers safely through dangerous hyperspace routes. While the jumps we perform are dangerous, these areas of hyperspace are the only deposit of the valuable Crystalis. Thus, our task is also to collect Crystalis on our way. You will be assigned a suitable ship and perform your first jumps soon, pilot. Welcome to F.L.O.W.!"


"Gratulation, Pilot. Du gehörst jetzt zu den Elitepiloten von F.L.O.W., dem Federal Lunar Operation Wing. Unser Aufgabe ist es, wichtige Fracht, Nachrichten oder Passagiere sicher durch gefährliche Hyperraumrouten zu bringen. Zwar sind die Sprünge, die wir durchführen, gefährlich, aber die Gegenden des Hyperraums, die wir durchfliegen sind das einzige Vorkommen des wertvollen Crystalis. Daher ist es auch unsere Aufgabe, das Crystalis auf dem Weg einzusammeln. Dir wird ein passendes Schiff zugeteilt werden und bald wirst du deine ersten Sprünge fliegen. Willkommen bei F.L.O.W.!"

==Scenario 1: Antimatter Problems==

===Session Intro===

"Good morning, pilot. Your today's mission is to fix some technical problems in Luna's industry. As always, report to the Department Of Psychological Enhancement to monitor your stress and performance level. It is crucial that you give D.O.P.E. accurate estimations, to ensure best performance among all of our pilots."


===Round Intro 1 (Baseline)===
"Thank you for your cooperation with D.O.P.E., pilot. Now report to the flight simulator in which you will perform a simulated hyperspace jump allowing us to measure your today's performance. Try to avoid the anomalies and collect as much Crystalis as you can."

===Round Extro 1 (Baseline)===
"We adapted your ship so it suits your status best, it is ready in the hangar for you. The briefing for the first jump will be on board via your commlink. Good luck and fly safe!"

===Round Intro 2===
"There has been a power failure in one of our outer-rim antimatter processing plants. Unfortunately, the base is not equipped to deal with this kind of incident. Your mission is to bring a team of engineers from this station there to repair the damage. The jump is easy, so take your chance to collect Crystalis!"

===Round Extro 2===
"Thank you. The maintenance team arrived safely and is now repairing the plant. It should be resuming operation by the end of the day."

===Round Intro 3===
"A load of antimatter from the plant has been loaded into your ship. It is urgently required by one of our mining bases in the Centauri solar system which is under attack by pirates. Its defence grid ran out of ammunition, it is your job to resupply it before the pirates destroy the base."

===Round Extro 3===
"You just saved a lot of innocent lives there. Take a break on the asteroid base and await your next orders."

===Round Intro 4===
"Hello, pilot! Your next jump will take you to the research station at Tau Ceti Alpha. You will pick up one of our top scientists on biogenetics there, Professor Wilmut.
His presence is required elsewhere, you will be briefed on take-off from Tau Ceti."

===Round Extro 4===
"Welcome to Tau Ceti. No time for breaks this time, Professor Wilmut has already boarded your ship. You have performed great so far, we have faith that you will complete the following mission successfully!"

===Round Intro 5===
"No time to lose, pilot. You will immediately commence your jump into the distant Hourglass Nebula, where at the transmitted coordinates you will find a gas harvesting station. Professor Wilmut will supervise the loading of your ship with a small amount of a special gas mix required in your final mission."

===Round Extro 5===
"The gas mix is being loaded onto your ship, but stay ready for take-off at all time! As soon as the loading finished, Professor Wilmut will board your ship and you will be required to commence your next jump."

===Round Intro 6===
"The final jump today will take you to a distant research station in deep space. The impact of dark matter on organisms is being investigated there. Sadly, an experiment went terribly wrong and the base staff hast lost control of large parts of the station to mutated organisms. Professor Wilmut will use the gas you picked up to initiate a complex process to undo the damage done there."

===Round Extro 6===
"Professor Wilmut will stay on the station for a while to monitor the process. Most of the station's staff had barricaded themselves in the control room and survived that way."

===Session Extro===
"Thank you for your excellent work today, pilot. We sorted out a safe hyperspace route for you to return to F.L.O.W.'s base in the orbit of Luna. Once you arrive, you will be debriefed and dismissed for today."
